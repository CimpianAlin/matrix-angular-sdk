Testing is done using Karma.


UNIT TESTING
============

Requires the following:
 - npm/nodejs
 - phantomjs

Requires the following node packages:
 - npm install jasmine
 - npm install karma
 - npm install karma-jasmine
 - npm install karma-phantomjs-launcher
 - npm install karma-junit-reporter

Make sure you're in this directory so it can find the config file and run:
  karma start

You should see all the tests pass.


E2E TESTING
===========

npm install protractor


Setting up e2e tests (only if you don't have a selenium server to run the tests
on. If you do, edit the config to point to that url):

  webdriver-manager update
  webdriver-manager start

  Create a file "environment-protractor.js" in this directory and type:
    module.exports = {
        seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',
        baseUrl: "http://localhost:8008",
        username: "YOUR_TEST_USERNAME",
        password: "YOUR_TEST_PASSWORD"
    }

Running e2e tests:
  protractor protractor.conf.js

NOTE: This will create a public room on the target home server.
